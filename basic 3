while loop:
===========
num = 0
while True:
        num + 1        
        num = num + 1
        print('line number = ' + str(num) )
        num = num + 1

the execution never stop until manually exit. because True always True. while loop always execute the program, because every time it checks the while condition, it set as True.

break:
======
num = 0
while True:
        num + 1        
        num = num + 1
        print('line number = ' + str(num) )
        num = num + 1
        break
        print('end')
#whil stops the process. because the break will end the function. if the while process meets a certain contition it will stop the process and will exit from the loop.

continue:
=========
num = 0
while num < 5:
    num += 1
    if num == 3:
        continue  # Skip the rest when num is 3
    print(num)
# continue will stop the process and return to the whil process to start and continue the remaining process.
# because the the continue works when the while meet a certain condition. at that time it will skip and go back to start of the whil funcion
