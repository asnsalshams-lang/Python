while loop:
===========


num = 0
while num < 5:
    num += 1
    if num == 3:
        continue  # Skip the rest when num is 3
    print(num)
# continue will stop the process and return to the whil process to start and continue the remaining process.
# because the the continue works when the while meet a certain condition. at that time it will skip and go back to start of the whil funcion
